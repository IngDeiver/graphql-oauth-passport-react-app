# graphql-oauth-passport-react-app
Graphql-oauth-passport-react-app is developed on React.js with which I consume a GraphQL API that I previously developed with express, apollo GraphQL server and Passport.js which allows stateless authentication, you can view the demo [here](https://graphql-oauth-server.herokuapp.com/graphql) and leave your star in this [repository ðŸ˜†](https://github.com/IngDeiver/passport-oauth-graphql-server).
I developed this application mainly for two reasons, to put into practice user authentication knowledge with Google, Facebook and by username / password and to provide the community with an implementation that will surely be useful in their projects ðŸ“•, so feel free to use this implementation as you like.
## Characteristics
- Local authentication of users with Google, Faceboo and user with password.
- Protection of local authentication that is saved in the browser through encryption.
- Allows you to post comments only to authenticated users.
- Only an author user can edit their comments.
- Being a stateless authentication, the data is validated on the server.
- Developed with GraphqQL using Apollo client
